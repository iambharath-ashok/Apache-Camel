# Why Camel 


-	Each organizations have separate departments like online, finance, transportation, distribution centers
-	And each departments have N number of applications
	- Each using different technologies to store data and expose the data
-	Applications needs to interact with each other and most of the times with external applications


## Enterprise Integration

-	Different departments and applications uses different technologies to store and expose the data
-	Application will face problems while integrating different systems
-	Latest technologies will try to solve those problems

	-	Kafka, REST, Soap, Elastic Search, JMS etc..
	
	
## Use cases


-	Transportation department expose their service with Rest Endpoints and Distribution Center Applications should create Rest Client Application to consume the service

-	Online Application should push the order placed by customer on portal to Transportation Dept or Application
-	Online application can use kafka to push the message to Transportation Application


## Need of Camel

-	There is an integration is required b/w these applications
-	Camel is built to support these integrations
-	Camel provides support wide variety of technologies
-	Camel is implementation for all the Integration Patterns
