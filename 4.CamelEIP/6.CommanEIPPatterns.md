# Common EIP Patterns


## Splitter:

-	Splitter Pattern allows to split the message into number of pieces and process them individually

Code Snippet:

	public class SimpleRouteBuilder extends RouteBuilder {
	//Split the content of the file into lines and the process it 
		@Override
		public void configure() throws Exception {
			from("file:C:/inputFolder").split().tokenize("\n").to("jms:queue:javainuse");
		}

	}
	
##	Message Filter

-	A Message Filter is a special form of a Content-Based Router
-	It examines the message content and passes the message to another channel if the message content matches certain criteria
-	Otherwise, it discards the message	

	Code Snippet:
	
		public class SimpleRouteBuilder extends RouteBuilder {

			@Override
			public void configure() throws Exception {
				from("file:C:/inputFolder").split().tokenize("\n").to("direct:test");
				
				//Message Filter is a type of Content Based routing. 
				//If condition satisfied perform a task else discard it.
				from("direct:test"). 
				filter(body().contains("javainuse1"))
				.to("jms:queue:javainuse1");	  
			}
		}
		
		
## Splitter and Aggregator

-	The Splitter from the EIP patterns allows you split a message into a number of pieces and process them individually
-	The Aggregator from the EIP patterns allows you to combine a number of messages together into a single message
